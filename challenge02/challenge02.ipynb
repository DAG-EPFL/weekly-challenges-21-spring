    "\n",
    "Your task is to write a function that, given a string of text (possibly with punctuation and line-breaks), returns a **list** of the **top 5** most occurring words (i.e., characters delimited by spaces), in descending order of the number of occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text should first be **lower-cased**, and thus you should only return lowercase words.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a text contains fewer than 5 unique words, you should return the top-X words (where X is the number of distinct words in the string) or an empty list if a text contains no words. For texts with more than five unique words, the tests will have an exact solution (i.e., no ties, so you can decide how to deal with them).\n",
    "\n",
    "(N.B. **\"words\"** only contain letters, no punctuation!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If the input is \"a a a a a b b b b c d d d e e e e e e f g g h\", your function should return the list \\['e', 'a', 'b', 'd', 'g'\\], because there are 6 \"e\", 5 \"a\", 4 \"b\", 3 \"d\" and 2 \"g\"."
